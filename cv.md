Education
======
* **2012 - 2016 PhD in Astronomy, Universidade de São Paulo, IAG**
    * **Doctoral Thesis:** [Kinematics and Stellar Populations of Galaxies in the Local Universe](assets/thesis.pdf) 
    * **Supervisor:** Prof. Cláudia Mendes de Oliveira
    * **Summary:** The environment has an important role in the morphological transformations of galaxies. Using spectroscopic observations, we have studied the physical mechanisms that led to morphological transformations at the environments of groups and clusters. In our first study (chapter 2), we used spectroscopic data to search for galaxy members in six loose and compact groups. We used the confirmed members to characterise the group's dynamical properties, and we also studied the central stellar population properties of each member. In the following three chapters, we focused our efforts to study NGC 3311, the dominant cD galaxy at the core of the Hydra I cluster, including a kinematic (chapter 3) and stellar population (chapter 4) mapping of the stellar halo of the system,  we have shown that the formation of its diffuse halo happened recently, with the merging events related to the formation of the BCG itself being responsible to unbound stars that ended up in the cD halo, with a contribution of stars from accretted satellite galaxies. Finally, in chapter 6, we show the preliminary results of our analysis of NGC using MUSE observations, which allowed a much more detailed study of the central part of NGC 3311. 

 * **2009 - 2011 Master's Degree in Astronomy, Universidade de São Paulo, IAG**
    * **Master's Thesis:** [Photometry, Decomposition, and Correlations for Nearby Spiral Galaxies from the GHASP Survey](assets/master_thesis.pdf) (Portuguese)
    * **Supervisor :** Prof. Cláudia Mendes de Oliveira
    * **Summary:**  Spiral galaxies obey several scaling relations relating their sizes, luminosities and kinematics. In this study, we have deployed a detailed analysis of the pho- tometry of 173 galaxies in the GHASP survey, one of the most precise and detailed surveys on the kinematics in the local universe, in order to obtain a precise characterization of such relations, including sub-components such as bulges and disks.
