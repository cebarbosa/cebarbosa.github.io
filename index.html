Welcome to my digital space!

I'm Kadu, a curious mind with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the universe and leveraging 
data to make meaningful insights. In the past, I served as a dedicated Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department 
of Astronomy at the prestigious IAG/USP, where I delved into the fascinating realm of galaxies and their 
stellar makeup. It was an awe-inspiring journey, one that nurtured my insatiable appetite for scientific 
problem-solving.

As life's cosmic dance continued, I found myself drawn to the dynamic world of data science. Embracing this 
exciting transition, I now thrive as a Data Scientist in a leading telecommunications company. In this role, 
I have the incredible opportunity to leverage cutting-edge technologies and data-driven strategies to unlock 
the full potential of information.

But my journey doesn't end there. I'm always seeking to push my limits and expand my horizons. Currently, 
I am also pursuing an MBA in Digital Business, enriching my skills to harness data's transformative power 
effectively.

On this platform, I invite you to join me as I navigate through the galaxies of data, exploring diverse realms 
from the cosmos to the business sphere. Expect to find captivating insights, thought-provoking ideas, and updates 
on my ventures and discoveries.

Beyond the scientific and business world, I cherish the little joys of life. Whether it's stargazing on a clear
night or savoring a cup of freshly brewed coffee, I believe in finding beauty in the simplest moments.

Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. Let's connect, learn, and share as we uncover the wonders 
that lie in the union of science and data.

See you among the stars,

Carlos
