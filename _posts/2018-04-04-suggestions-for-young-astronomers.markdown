At the beginning of a career as an astronomer, there is an apparently insurmoufindntable number of things that we should get familiar even before we start to work in the science of our projects, which are seldom covered in our undergrad years: to learn the nomenclature and jargon of our fields, to understand the goals of our projects and how to achieve that goal, and to use programming techniques to get the job done. 

While there is little to do to overcome the first and the issues, except for much reading on the specifics of our projects, the third is actually something that is a little more general. Here, I keep a small summary of the resources that have been proved to be valuable in my research, with the hope of helping grad students in their way to their degrees.

The most important source of papers is the [ADS abstract service](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html), where you can search for papers by name, title, keyword, etc. In particular, I find it very useful the use of the caret symbol "^" in the author list to indicate the name of the first author. In the example bellow, I am showing how you can easily find my latest paper using very little effort.
