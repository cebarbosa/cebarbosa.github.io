It is not easy to be a grad student. For students of astronomy coming from physics or other departments, the challenge to enter in the field includes not only getting god grades at the subjects, but also to start to think hard about the science you are making. In the beginning, everything is hard: get to understand the jargon of your field, read a lot of papers, learn a few programming languages, etc. 

In the last months, there were a few undergrads asking me for some useful tips to get started in Astronomy, and then I thought about what I find most useful in my life today as a young scientist that can be useful for most people. So, I started this series about life hacks to make astronomy every day, starting to the most useful place to find papers: the SAO/NASA ADS service (aka ADS).

Life hacks in the ADS

We have to read (a lot) of papers to make our own, and there is a simple place where you can get them all: the [ADS abstract service](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html), where you can search for papers by name, title, keyword, etc. **The first life hack that I use all the time here is the use of the caret symbol "^" in the author list to indicate the name of the first author.** In the example bellow, I am showing how you can easily find my latest paper using very little effort.

If you hit the search using the exemple above, you will find a few papers (as of today, only three), which will make your life easier when looking for a paper. There are a few interesting things in the query results page, such as sorting by a number of options (citations, date, etc) which you may find useful. In particular, this page can be used to generate a complete bibliography (such as your own to be used in your CV) among other things. However, what you do most of the time is simply find the paper you want and them clicking on it to get more options. 

In general, by clicking into any paper, there will be lots of links in the top of the page, followed by the details of the paper itself (title, authors, summary). To download the peer-reviewed papers, we sometimes fall into a paywall. This happens when we are not using the network of a university (which usually pays for your access from there) or if the university does not pays for a given journal. However, **you can still read the paper anyway by clicking into the "ArXiv e-print" link in the top menu.** The Arxiv is another important resource for papers (which I will comment in another post).


Finally, **the third life hack using ADS is found under a link called "Bibtex entry for this abstract" below the abstract.** The reason is simple: whenever you are writing a paper/proposal/project/report, you have to include the bibliography, and in our field, most things are written in Latex. This link gives us a simple bibtex text, which you can use during your compilation of the latex file to produce the bibliography automatically. 

These are the main features that I use in my daily routine. Let me know if you have more life hacks to use in ADS!
