Hi! This is my first post in my new website, now hosted on GitHub and using the Jekyll engine! There's still some work to be done for the transition, and I will keep this project and my current website [www.cebarbosa.com](www.cebarbosa.com)  still as is during the time of transition. However, I am already happy enough with the results, and I feel encouraged with this platform to start a blog regarding (mostly) scientific topics. 

I intend to use this blog for miscelaneous purposes related to my work as an astronomer, such as programming, comments on papers in my field, divulgation for own work and projects I am involved, and other things that I may find useful to share. Keep tuned for updates (I will include RSS support in the website soon), and let me know if you have some blog post idea!
