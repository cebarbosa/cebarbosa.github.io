I am Carlos Eduardo Barbosa, a professional astronomer working in academic research in the field of Extragalactic Astronomy. Currently, I am working as a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), where I am involved with the [S-PLUS](http://www.splus.iag.usp.br/en/) project and with studies of stellar populations in spatially resolved galaxies.
