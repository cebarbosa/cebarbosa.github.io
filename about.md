I am Carlos Eduardo Barbosa, a professional astronomer working in academic research in the field of Extragalactic Astronomy. I am currently a research associate at the Steward Observatory, where I am studying ultra diffuse galaxies. I am also a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).
