Welcome to my professional website!

I am Carlos Eduardo Barbosa, a professional astronomer working in academic research in the field of Extragalactic Astronomy. I am currently a visiting research associate at the Steward Observatory, where I am studying ultra diffuse galaxies. I am also a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), my alma matter. 

My current interest is the study of the stellar populations of nearby galaxies, which means, I love to study images and spectra of those beautiful galaxies and I try to learn something about their ages, chemical composition and dynamics. 

My main field of research is extragalactic astronomy, the study of galaxies other than our own. In particular, I have been studying the kinematics and the stellar populations of nearby galaxies using two-dimensional observations, including integral field spectroscopy, multi-object spectroscopy and photometry, aiming to understand the past and current states of galaxies, measure the chemical abundances of their  stars, and to connect these results in connection with models of galaxy evolution. My research interests also involve the use of novel techniques for data analysis, such as Machine Learning and Bayesian statistical modeling, to obtain deeper insights and to explore big data sets of astronomical surveys.
