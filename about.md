Welcome to my professional website!

I am an astronomer, and I'm currenly a FAPESP post-doctoral fellow in Astronomy of the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of São Paulo (IAG/USP), the same place where I also obtained my Ph.D and my Master's degree titles. Previously, I have got a bachelor's degree in Physics at the Institute of Physics of the University of São Paulo. 

My main field of research is extragalactic astronomy, the study of galaxies other than our own. In particular, I have been studying the kinematics and the stellar populations of nearby galaxies using two-dimensional observations, including integral field spectroscopy, multi-object spectroscopy and photometry, with the goal of understand the past and current states of galaxies, to understand their composition and formation, how they have evolved to be in their current state and what are the their current important interactions. My research interests also involve the use of novel techniques for data analysis, such as Machine Learning and Bayesian statistical modeling, to obtain deeper insights and to explore big data sets of astronomical surveys. 

Also, feel free to give me ideas for post in my blog :)
