Welcome!

I am Carlos Eduardo Barbosa, a professional astronomer working in academic research in the field of Extragalactic Astronomy. I am currently a visiting research associate at the Steward Observatory, where I am studying ultra diffuse galaxies. I am also a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), my alma matter. 

My current interest is the study of the stellar populations of nearby galaxies, which means, I love to study images and spectra of those beautiful galaxies and I try to learn something about their ages, chemical composition and dynamics.In particular, during my PhD, I have focused in one galaxy -- NGC 3311 -- the largest galaxy in the image below, to understand how these kind of galaxies come to be.

However, I am also interested in other aspects of research, such as the development of techniques to improve our measurements of galaxy properties, and I am particularly interested in developing Bayesian methods to study galaxies. Here at Steward Observatory, I have been developing methods to study all kinds of galaxies, and this led me to study other, *much smaller* galaxies called ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs).

I plan to explain more about my works in future posts but please, feel free to give me ideas for post in my blog :)
